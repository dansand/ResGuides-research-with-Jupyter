# ResGuides: Python for Science

This book draws mainly from the resources listed below. We tried to incoporate what we felt were the best parts of these courses, and package it into a coherent set of lessons that can be taught in around 1.5 days. At the end of the course, we provide a few longer examples that could be given as homework. This book was enabled by Research Platforms at the University of Melbourne.
