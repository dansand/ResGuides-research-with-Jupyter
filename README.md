# ResGuides: Research with Jupyter

The first section of this book book provides an introduction to the Python programming language, aimed at people who have never used a programming language.  It then provides a introduction to Scientific Python, often called The Scientific Python Stack; again intended for people who are not familiar with these libraries. The focus of the Scientific Python is around the simple managment, anlysis and visualisation of _Numerical_ data, in short'data wrangling'. At the end of the course, we provide a few longer examples that could be given as homework. This book was enabled by Research Platforms at the University of Melbourne.  We hope that after taking this course you will be equipped to begin to tackle your own data.
