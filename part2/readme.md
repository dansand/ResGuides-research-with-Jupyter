# The Scientific Python Stack

SciPy refers to a collection of open source software for scientific computing in Python, and particularly a specified set of core packages.

Core Packages:

* NumPy, the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them.
* The SciPy library, a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
* Matplotlib, a mature and popular plotting package, that provides publication-quality 2D plotting as well as rudimentary 3D plotting
* pandas, providing high-performance, easy to use data structures.
* SymPy, for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra.
* IPython, a rich interactive interface, letting you quickly process data and test ideas. The IPython notebook works in your web browser, allowing you to document your computation in an easily reproducible form.
nose, a framework for testing Python code.
